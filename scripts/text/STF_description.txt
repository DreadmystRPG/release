Syntax for dynamic values:
	$E1D1 = Effect1, Data1 (1-3)
	$INVL = Interval
	$DUR = Duration

Using 'e1d1' will only show the base value, not the scaled value if it's a level 2 spell

Scaled values from the server:
	$E1min = effect1 min (1-3)
	$E1max = effect2 max (1-3)

Example:
	$E1min-$E1max

That will appear as '5-10'

For these you don't have to worry about if its data1,2,3
